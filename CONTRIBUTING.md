## Staging

- Prescriptive
  - Exploratory
  - Draft
  - Final
- Descriptive
  - Draft
  - Final

Prescriptive specifications are intended to describe future 
implementations or, in some cases, changes to existing implementations.

Specification documents should include a descriptor in their heading that 
indicates their status in the staging process. e.g. "Prescriptive - Draft", 
or "Descriptive - Final".

## Governance

Merge rules:
 * Exploratory Stage
   * Authors can merge changes into exploratory specs at their own discrection.
 * Draft Stage
   * Authors must attempt to reach a consensus between all active participants
   before a merge.
   * If no objections are raised in a 48 hours period changes can be merged.
   * If objections cannot be resolved the change can be voted on by the IPLD Team.
 * Final Stage
   * Improvements that have a consensus can be merged.
   * Changes to behavior should not be merged unless absolutely necessary and 
   agreed upon by a vote of the IPLD Team.
 
## IPLD Team

The IPLD Team consists of currently active IPLD developers.
