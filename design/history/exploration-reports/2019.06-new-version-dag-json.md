#129: Proposal: new version of dag-json (open)
----------------------------------------------
Opened 2019-06-11T03:53:16Z by mikeal

This spec change would resolve the outstanding issue of `dag-json` not being able to represent the “/“ key.

Since “/“ is already reserved, we use that key for the version definition, which makes this new version backwards compatible with all of the existing `dag-json` data.

This change would also set up `dag-json` to store data outside of the actual node data, which could be used similar to how tags are used in cbor or for something like https://github.com/ipld/js-generics/issues/3

# Specification: DAG-JSON

**Status: Descriptive - Final**

DAG-JSON supports the full [IPLD Data Model](../data-model-layer/data-model.md).

## Format

### Simple Types

All simple types except binary are supported natively by JSON.

Contrary to popular belief, JSON as a format supports Big Integers. It's only
JavaScript itself that has trouble with them. This means JS implementations
of `dag-json` can't use the native JSON parser and serializer.

### Version 0

This is an old version of `dag-json` that reserved the `"/"` key in order to
represent binary and link data types.

#### Binary Type

```javascript
{"/": { "base64": String }}
```

#### Link Type

```javascript
{"/": String /* base encoded CID */}
```

### Version 1

#### Format

The internal data format is valid JSON but is **NOT** identical to the decoded
node data codecs produce.

Example internal format:

{ "/": { "_": 1 },

Is the motivation _just_ to support `/` keys? IMO, dag-json exists so users could read and write IPLD using JSON. I'm concerned this format looses that.

If we _just_ want to support `/` in keys, we could use some form of escaping syntax. For full backwards compatibility, we could do something like `{"/": {"literal": foobar}}`. Alternatively, we can _probably_ allow escaping forward slash without breaking too much: `//` -> `/`.

I’m a little confused by this use case, because the `dag-json` codec already isn’t `json`. If you want to take a block of existing `json` data you should just use a `json` codec (which we should implement since it would be trivial).

If you want to take existing JSON data and add links to it, you’re going to have to use an encoding interface anyway and all of these details are invisible.

Is there a case I’m missing where you want `dag-json` instead of `json` **and** you’re interacting directly with the block format?

> Is the motivation just to support / keys?

Yes, that’s the only thing we get out of this change. Using “/“ as a key will *still* be highly problematic for anyone using paths and selectors, but this would fix the issue at the codec level.

I’m actually not too worried about “/“ being reserved in `dag-json` but other people seem to be. I opened this PR to show what it would take to fix the issue, given some people are concerned.

dag-json wasn't designed to be 100% compatible but still mostly compatible. I agree we should have a plain JSON format for users who just want JSON but the point of _this_ format was to provide a familiar, JSON-like format that mostly "just works" (i.e., you can link up existing JSON objects).

Another thing that might be worth keeping in mind. Having a format you can easily use as exchange format for tests: https://github.com/multiformats/rust-cid/pull/17#issuecomment-502395133

@mikeal We decided to put this into design history, but after having a closer look  I think the discussion can be easily be summed up. Instead of having it archived automatically I suggest that we create a proper exploration report like https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/035683c97d0280de5e2d490822d63ad618a8acab/design/history/exploration-reports/2019.06-unixfsv2-spike-01.md. @mikeal if you think it's worth having it there, could you please create a new PR with that report?

Closing as this was mostly informational. @vmx will use his script to create an exploration report for this.
