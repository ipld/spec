IPLD Data Model and Map keys
============================

**Author**: Volker Mische ([@vmx])

This is an exploration report about how we define the keys of the [IPLD Data Model] `Map` kind. This is not specifically about strings in the IPLD Data Model, although it touches that topic.


Starting point
--------------

The [current version of the IPLD Data Model spec] doesn't say anything about the shape of Map keys in the definition of Maps at all, though in the "Motivation" section it states:

> IPLD Data Model in that it cannot support some advanced features (like non-string keys for Maps) because support for such a feature is not common enough among programming languages.

So Map keys are strings. It doesn't go into detail about the definition of "string". It is likely the same kind of string as the IPLD Data Model `String` kind, which "should be UTF-8 text", but it could also be other definitions of "string".


### Definition of strings

And the problem is exactly the definition of "string". To me, preferring coding in Python or Rust, "string" means UTF-8, or more generally spoken a sequence of valid Unicode characters. In the past haven't actually thought about exactly we are defining strings in the IPLD Data Model, I just implemented/treated them as always valid Unicode.

I also just learnt recently that JavaScript is using [UTF-16] internally (just as Java does), which can store arbitrary bytes, hence a string may contain invalid Unicode characters.


Discussions
-----------

A more precise specification of Map keys is needed. This problem was convoluted with the discussion about how strings should be defined. Which happened at a [Gist from @warpfork], lead to [response from me] and yet another [doc about the IPLD Data Model in general]. After long discussions on IRC with @warpfork about all this, we found a way to separate this problem from the discussion about the `String` kind representation.


### Clear distinction of the Data Model

In order to have a rather self-contained document, I want to repeat a few things from my [doc about the IPLD Data Model in general]. We should make a clear distinction between IPLD Codecs, the IPLD Data model and the programming language.

 - IPLD Codec: A Codec specifies how IPLD Data model kinds are actually serialized. As full round-trippability is desired, there should be only one way to convert a Data Model kind into a Codec and back.
 - IPLD Data Model: The Ipld Data Model only specifies the properties of a kind. It doesn't specify any memory layouts or how things are serialized (that's part of the Codec). Kinds might also be represented differently in different programming languages.
 - Programming languages: The programming language represents each IPLD Data Model kind in its own type system. Those types aren't (even can't) be unified across languages.


### Using a specific kind as key

As mentioned before, I wanted to separate this problem from the discussion about the representation of the `String` kind. Hence using it as the map key is not an option. This makes the `Bytes` kind the only option.

If you are using a language which supports arbitrary bytes in string (e.g. JavaScript, Go), then you might want to use that string type for `Map` keys (it might even be the only sensible way, e.g. in JavaScript). Though you might still want to use another type if `Bytes` are used as values. Having the same kind being different programming language types under certain circumstances is (while technically possible) difficult to understand and reason about.

The same applies to codecs. For text based Codecs like DAG-JSON, you would encode the `Bytes` kind as Base64. But `Map` keys are expected to be valid UTF-8 most of the time, so you would want to have readable (not Base64 encoded) representation which does some escaping in case there are non UTF-8 characters. So again you'd have two different representation for arbitrary bytes based things.

And it's even true for binary Codecs. Most Codecs have some type to store arbitrary bytes. Though they might not allow for arbitrary bytes in map keys. You could solve this again with a custom encoding to turn them into valid UTF-8. But you wouldn't apply that for the `Bytes` kind.


Solution
--------

To solve this problem, we see the `Map` kind more holistically and make the keys part of it. We specify that the keys of the `Map` kind need to be arbitrary bytes. This aligns well with the Data Model only defining properties and not actual memory layouts or other representations. It is now up to the Codecs and the programming language to decide how to represent it.

So for example you could decide that the DAG-CBOR codec is using the CBOR String type for the keys for backwards compatibility reasons. Though your programming language, e.g. Python could use its `bytes` type as map keys.
